<head><title>Server Rules</title></head>
<body>There are several rules we have here. If you disagree with them drop us a suggestion on the forum. <font size="2" color="red">Don't go around insulting the admins, we take time out of our day to keep the server fun and running. We don't appreciate shitty comments and sarcasm.</font> <font face="Arial" size="3"><br/>
<br/>
	<ol>
		<li><font size="6" color="red">Don't be a dick!!</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">If you feel like you shouldn’t be doing something you’re probably right. Doing something wrong for shits and giggles, because you were bored, because you want to actively annoy other players; You get the idea.</font><br />
			</li>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Do not kill people on the emergency shuttle BEFORE IT DOCKS AT CENTRAL COMMAND.</font></li>
	<br><br/>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Even if you and a friend both agree to fight on the shuttle, it still convinces other people to start beating one another. So don’t do it.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Seriously don’t fucking do it.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Don’t release anything dangerous on the emergency shuttle before it docks with Central Command.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">This includes setting off bombs, releasing slimes from a closet, etc.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Seriously, don’t fucking do it. If people are harmed as a result, you will be banned.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Antagonists are exempt from this rule.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Do not discuss the current round in OOC</font>.</li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do not talk about anyone or anything of the current round in OOC. This includes yelling who the antags are, where your body is, if security is being bad, if you just died and so on. It's a shitty thing to do and is an automatic ban despite your intentions as it ruins the round.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do not use parentheses, emoticons, acronyms or post links in IC.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">You can get by with whispering out of character things to people (such as teaching new players how to play and using words and phrases such as ‘round’, ‘click on’, etc) so long as you follow 3.1</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do not misuse custom emotes (/me) to display information you’d have no way of emoting (ie. /me is innocent /me is a mime /me doesn’t care you asshole)</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">An administrator’s decision is final.</font>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">If you feel you were banned for the wrong reason, then you may appeal your ban on the forums. It will be looked at by several admins rather than just the banning one.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">When an admin has declared an action “valid” or “legitimate” it is because he is unable to divulge information which might ruin the round, they can’t be incorrect or wrong by saying this.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Failure to respond to administrator private messages is an automatic permaban. You are usually given a small grace period.</font> </li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Logging out when an administrator is messaging you is also an automatic permaban.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Admiteddly sometimes people might have connection issues or computer freezes and the like. That is fair enough, if you appeal it on those grounds it's much more likely to be reversed.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Don’t have objectives? You’re not a traitor!</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Even though you selected an antagonist role in the pre-game lobby, this does not automatically make you an antagonist.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">If you are not an antagonist or sanctioned by an admin/event to do so, antagonist actions (murder, grief, mass sabotage) are strictly not allowed.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">If you grief, sabotage, release hostile mobs, generally cause dickish chaos, destroy parts of the station etc. because you're bored or want to liven up the round, you will be banned instantly.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Do not use adminhelp unless you require administrator assistance to resolve an issue or ask a question.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">When using adminhelp, provide as much information about your issue as you can within the first report.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do not use caps lock or emoticons in adminhelp; We need legible and concise wording in a calm manner with as little clutter as possible.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">If you adminhelp about someone griefing you and we find out you were killed because you started a fight with someone and lost, then you’ll have dropped yourself in it and we’ll deal with it accordingly.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Do not roleplay as a crazy/mental/sociopathic/murderer/paranoid/high/drunk/drugged up individual. This excuse is always used to justify murdering people, griefing and being a dick under the pretense of behaving how your character would.</font> </li>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">If you repeatedly end up being incompetent as a certain job or disconnecting as head roles without informing an admin we have the right to job ban you until we're confident enough you won't slip up again. Your ineptitude or leaving can often cause major problems later on in the round.</font> </li>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Self defense is allowed in most circumstances. Defending yourself against people attacking you for no reason is justified self defense. If someone is trying to arrest you for a crime you committed, resisting arrest is perfectly alright but killing that person so you don’t get arrested isn’t self defence. Restraining someone after they attacked you, then proceeding to beat them into crit is not self defense. Only in cases when you are at a visible risk of death due to another person’s actions can self defense truly be considered valid.</font></li>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Never purposefully accusing someone of being a traitor that leads to their death without justification or evidence supporting it.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Accusing other people you want killed or who have annoyed you, of being a traitor or a syndicate with no evidence as an easy way to get them griefed will get you banned.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Accusing the AI of being MALF or Rogue because it wouldn’t let you into a restricted area or the power went off in your room is a shitty reaction and will be treated as such. (See rule 11 for further details)</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Completely valid if you’re a traitor or an antagonist; deceit away and finger point to your heart’s content.</font></li>
	    </ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Rules for interacting with the AI</font>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Threatening to kill yourself if the AI doesn’t do what you want is not allowed and may get you banned.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">A crew member committing suicide and the AI opening or failing to open a door are two unrelated events. Opening the door does not nullify your ability to kill yourself, and refusing to open the door does not force you to kill yourself. You may kill yourself because the AI doesn’t open the door, but that doesn’t mean the AI caused you're not required to open doors due to death by inaction.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Generally, the AI should assume that enforcing access limits is a method of preventing harm by keeping people away from areas or objects that could cause harm to them or authorized access if and only if a greater harm would result from not letting the person in. An example would be letting someone into Medbay in an emergency.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Repeatedly saying that the AI is rogue or malfunctioning due to your own poor understanding of its laws is a stupid thing to do, and may result in you being banned.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">The AI’s laws take priority over the fact that the AI is not required to follow orders (law 2) that would result in human harm (law 1).</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Malf laws or 0 laws take priority over iority in the order that they are listed. Law 1 is higher priority than law 2, and law 2 is higher priority than law 3. This mall the laws listed below them.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">If an AI has no laws loaded, it can do whatever it wants. It does not have antagonist objectives and is not therefore required to kill anyone but may do so of its own will.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">The AI is still a player and other rules do apply, ie rule 1. Unless it has a good reason to start killing people when it has no laws then it generally should not.)</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Rather than instantly blowing up a Cyborg when you suspect the AI has been   modified or is MALF, please gather concrete evidence as you are possibly ruining the rest of the round for that player on a hunch.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Metagaming can be defined as any out of character action made by a player's character which makes use of knowledge that the character is not meant to be aware of. While we operate on a round basis it’s not acceptable to retain any knowledge from the previous rounds unless it was something harmless like an admin event or becoming friends with a character.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Using another player's viewpoint to gather information that one's own character doesn't have access comes under this. ie. you and a friend are playing a normal round, he gets killed instantly then dragged into maintenance. nobody sees him get dragged away and he didn’t say anything ICly but he tells you out of game over voip or chat and you run to his aid and ruin the antagonists day. We watch for this behaviour very closely because it’s dickish and ruins it.</font> </li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Holding grudges over rounds and even inbetween days, this is called meta grudging. ie. Someone slips you up and steals your shoes last round then locks you in a room. You get out eventually but the round ends. You then proceed find him in the next round and start attacking him and try to steal his shoes and lock him in a room. This is a dickish move and will be treated as such; if someone is attacking you repeatedly throughout rounds admin help it.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">What happens as a ghost, stays as a ghost. If you get killed, see people in deadchat give away the names of the antags then get cloned you're not allowed to use any of that information. No matter how trivial it may seem to you.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br/><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">There are only two instances where grief protection is negated.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Reading "Woody's Got Wood" over the radio or intercom as any job immediately forfeits all of your grief protection, but only your protection. People can grief you for reading it but you can't grief them BECAUSE you're reading it.</font> </li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">When you are a monkey you can be a dick to people at will but can be killed at the same time. We will not intervene if someone kills you as a monkey, however if you purposefully get yourself monkied just so you can go around killing people we'll refer you back to rule 1 and punish you.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br/><br/>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Space Dungeons and Dragons, because you're nerds.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">You can only play it if you are an unimportant job, Librarian, Assistant, Clown and Mime. If you shrug off duties to play it you will be jobbanned as it's the same as abandoning your post.</font> </li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">You cannot play if you're an antagonist as you are equally giving up doing your job.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">It's okay to do occasionally, doing it every single round 10 rounds in a row is not okay. The more people on, the more strain the server is under, if there are 8 of you literally spending every waking hour playing SDND and wasting server resources when you could be playing dnd over steam chat or IRC then you will be punished.</font></li>
		</ol>
	<br/><br/>
	<li><font face="Arial" size="4">Delta Security Alert is the imposition of special power to security for a temporary period when disobedience of the law becomes widespread or enemy subversion has gained a foothold.</font></li>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Security; You are embewed with special temporary powers to quell uprising, mutinies and all other threats to the station via any means neccesary. You have to the right to defend yourself or others and can take any actions to prevent crime and harm to the station or it's occupants. Suppress dissent with extreme brutality but by no means attack innocents or superiors.<font> </li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="3">Non-Security; The suspension of space law, nanotrasen staff rights will be in effect. DO not antagonise or harras security during this period and give them your full co-operation. They can and will use lethal force to disable attackers, revolutionaries </font></li>
		</ol>
	<br/><br/>
	<font face="Arial" size="3">This is not a comprehensive list. You're using Foos's server and his bandwidth/money, and as Draconian as it sounds he has the final say on who stays and who goes.</font><br/>
	<font face="Arial" size="3">This list can and will be added to and modified whenever we deem it appropriate, always check regularly for any updates.</font><br/>
