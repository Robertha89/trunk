		<li class="rscadd">Introducing the new preferences panel. Job preferences, character setup and general preferences are all on one screen.<br>This screen is available anytime during the game, you can access it via the "preferences" verb. This allows you to change settings such as ghost-sight etc via the panel. This allows you to setup your characters for the next round, before the current one has even finished.<br>Please report any bugs (including loss of savefiles) on the forum. Thanks x</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Clown name, AI name, pAI name and pAI description have been moved from the old (buggy+clunky) popup dialogues into your preferences screen.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Leaving any name blank in your preferences will mean you will get a random-name each round. This applies to pAI name, clown name and AI name too.</li>
		<li class="tweak">The number of character save slots was increased to 5. So you can develop more RP characters.</li>
		<li class="tweak">The pai-personality request system was tidied up and simplified. Available pAI personalities will be listed immediately!</li>
		<li class="tweak">Switching character tab on the preferences screen will save your character before switching to the new slot.</li>
		<li class="tweak">New characters on the preferences panel are pre-randomised, so no more bald-diaper manbaby guy as the default.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The preferences screen now has tooltips. These will explain the various options available to you.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Responsive power-networks! If you're providing enough power to the network, everything recharges much much faster. In many cases instantly!<br>If you're setting up the engine after a complete blackout, watch the powermonitor as each APC charges full one-by-one; it's pretty cool looking :3</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Recharger stations (for guns and such) now work correctly. (thanks Necromorpheus)</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Resolved a lot of issues with power distribution. High-usage departments such as atmosia shouldn't lose power so much. (thanks tinfoiltophat)</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Nanotrasen has upgraded SMES firmware! Power is no longer wasted. SMES units distribute power more evenly (they take turns to be the first smes to provide power), so the right-hand smes emptying faster than the others should not be so much of a problem.<br>In the future, these changes may allow for more interesting setups for engineers to play with, such as diverting power from medbay/research to shitcurity/bridge, in the event of a revolution?</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Lighting and various other things initialize shortly before spawn. So there won't be that period after you spawn where everything is dark/unpowered and you can barely move.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Rad-collectors now only use plasma when they actually generate power. They now use a reasonable amount of plasma. They used to drain at 0.001 plasma per cycle, meaning they never needed refilling. They'll now need refilling every 2-3 hours. Less-frequently if you fill them to the max. Using an analyzer on them will reveal how much plasma is left, without the hassle of removing the tank.</li>

	<h3 class="author"><font color='purple'>Carnie</font> updated:</h3>
	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="wip">Most of the core-systems in the game are being reworked in an attempt to reduce lag. Don't get too excited, there isn't much in the way of speed-improvments in this update.<br><font color='purple'><b>Please report any irregularities/bugs/freakish-events <a href='http://facepunchss13.proboards.com/thread/1868/bug-reports'>HERE</a>.</font></b> Thankyou!<br>PS a general note about power-systems: the power subsystem runs less frequently now, so when you're turning on power at an APC, do not be alarmed if it takes a few seconds to power up. This can be tweaked easily, so please let me know if it feels wrong or whatever.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can now set the levels at which the different power channels of APCs turn off in AUTO mode. Before, these values were hardcoded. For example, this would allow engineers to configure the engineering APC to prioritise equipment power over lighting and environmental systems, meaning the singulo containment would be the last thing to fail.<br>The way this works is pretty simple (although it doesn't look simple). The percentage value you see when you have access to an APC, indicates the minimum amount of charge the APCs cell must have for that system to be on. Obviously, if you set the minimum to 0%, that system will always attempt to be on - This is referred to as AlwaysOn. On the otherhand, if set to 100%, it will always be off (since the cell never has more than 100% charge) - This is referred to as AlwaysOff. Anything in-between is referred to as Auto.<br>There are buttons for These settings, and a 'Default' button to reset this percentage to its default value. This would be the same as clicking 'Auto' in the old system.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Solars have been reworked somewhat. The solar control must be synced with the solars and tracker manually. This is simply to reduce the amount of legwork the system has to do every tick. As before, solars and tracker must be wired before they can be discovered by the solar-control computer. Solar arrays should generally generate about 8000 Watts-per-second when they are directly facing the sun. Solars now rotate instantly.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The sun's behavior is slightly more varied in the speeds it can rotate at</li>
		<li class="tweak">Admins: The MC stats are now much more accurate, so don't be alarmed by those big numbers, those systems were always that slow ,_, I've identified the problems causing them and they're on my TODO list.</li>
